3. Enable `Developer Mode` and Choose `Load unpacked extension...`

Still working on it...

## How to Use
1. Go to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)
2. Choose a location and a view you like in street view mode
3. Click the StreetView-Screenshotter icon
4. UI should disappear, and a screenshot with GPS location should be taken and downloaded automatically

_You can add a custom keyboard shortcut to screenshot in `chrome://extensions/shortcuts/` for Chrome and `edge://extensions/shortcuts/` for Edge_

**Note:** If you use this extension in other websites instead of Google Map Street View, the CSS modification and screenshot will still be triggered.
